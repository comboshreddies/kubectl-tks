TODO:

code quality:
* change list.go to use opDecode - do not implement parsing more than once
* implement error wrapping, unwrapping

feature:
* OP_CAPTURE (each pod window capture in file per pod with argument for filename)
  what will be the shortcut as there is already _C ?, maybe PRINT_SCREEN
* Check timings check, make different ctrl+c or ctrl+\ (detach/terminate)
* add session-name to set of rendered/template variables available items so script can be
  aware of session it runs to
* In k8s.go consider recording containers name list []string, currently not needed, maybe for
some additional functionality
* add kct_cli shortcut that replaces field with kubectl switch options (same as _ but without kubectl)

architecture:
* switch to managing windows by pod-name not by index (as index can change)
  -R as alternative to -T to reuse not to terminate, should wait for managing windows by pod-name
