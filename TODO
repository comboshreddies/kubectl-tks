TODO:

code quality:
* implement error wrapping, unwrapping

feature:
* OP_CAPTURE (each pod window capture in file per pod with argument for filename)
  what will be the shortcut as there is already _C ?, maybe PRINT_SCREEN
* Check timings check, make different ctrl+c or ctrl+\ (detach/terminate)
* add session-name to set of rendered/template variables available items so script can be
  aware of session it runs to
* In k8s.go consider recording containers name list []string, currently not needed, maybe for
some additional functionality
* add kct_cli shortcut that replaces field with kubectl switch options (same as _ but without kubectl)
* add ability manipulate (create/update/delete) scripts, shortcuts and podMap from command line
* conditional variables, used to put "-n namespace" if namespace is not empty or something like
* add -X and -A for terminate and attach, overriding/forcing last terminal TERMINATE/ATTACH command from cli

architecture:
* switch to managing windows by pod-name not by index (as index can change)
  -R as alternative to -T to reuse not to terminate, should wait for managing windows by pod-name
