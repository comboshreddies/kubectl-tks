TODO:

In k8s.go consider senting containers name list []string, currently not needed

OP_CAPTURE (each pod window capture in file per pod with argument for filename)

Check timings check, make different ctrl+c or ctrl+\ (detach/terminate)

expand shortcuts in info

switch to managing windows by pod-name not by index (as index can change)
-R as alternative to -T to reuse not to terminate, should wait for managing windows by pod-name

add session-name to set of rendered/template variables available items so script can be
aware of session it runs to
